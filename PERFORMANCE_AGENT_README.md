## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. PerformanceAgent
The main orchestrator that coordinates all performance monitoring activities.

```python
from webiq.core.performance_agent import PerformanceAgent

# Initialize the Performance Agent
agent = PerformanceAgent()

# Track agent execution
await agent.track_agent_execution(
    agent_id="web_scraper",
    action="extract_data",
    execution_time=2.5,
    success=True,
    session_id="session_001"
)
```

#### 2. CostTracker
Monitors and analyzes costs across different models and services.

```python
# Track model usage costs
await cost_tracker.track_model_usage(
    model="gpt-4",
    input_tokens=1000,
    output_tokens=500,
    session_id="session_001"
)
```

#### 3. ResourceMonitor
Tracks system resource utilization in real-time.

```python
# Get current resource snapshot
snapshot = await resource_monitor.get_snapshot()
print(f"CPU: {snapshot['cpu_percent']}%, Memory: {snapshot['memory_percent']}%")
```

#### 4. RealTimeOptimizer
Provides real-time optimization suggestions for upcoming actions.

```python
# Get optimization for next action
optimization = await optimizer.optimize_next_action(
    current_state={"recent_performance": metrics},
    upcoming_action="web_scraping"
)
```

#### 5. PerformanceDashboard
Generates comprehensive performance dashboards and reports.

```python
# Get dashboard data
dashboard_data = await dashboard.get_dashboard_data()
print(f"System Health: {dashboard_data['system_health']['score']}%")
```

## 📊 Metrics and Analytics

### Metric Types

- **EXECUTION_TIME**: Agent execution duration
- **LATENCY**: Network and API response times
- **COST**: Financial costs (API calls, model usage)
- **SUCCESS_RATE**: Operation success/failure rates
- **ERROR_RATE**: Error frequency and patterns
- **RESOURCE_USAGE**: CPU, memory, disk usage

### Performance Metrics

```python
from webiq.core.performance_agent import PerformanceMetric, MetricType

metric = PerformanceMetric(
    metric_id="unique_id",
    metric_type=MetricType.EXECUTION_TIME,
    value=2.5,
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    agent_id="web_scraper",
    session_id="session_001",
    action_context={
        "action": "extract_data",
        "success": True,
        "url": "https://example.com"
    }
)
```

## 🚀 Integration with WebIQ System

### Enhanced Agents Integration

The Performance Agent is seamlessly integrated into the enhanced agents system:

```python
# In enhanced_agents.py
class PerformanceMonitoringAgent:
    async def monitor_execution(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        # Track performance metrics
        await self.performance_agent.track_agent_execution(
            agent_id=state.current_agent,
            action=state.current_step,
            execution_time=execution_time,
            success=success,
            session_id=state.session_id
        )
        
        # Apply real-time optimizations
        optimizations = await self.performance_agent.get_real_time_optimizations()
        state.current_optimizations = optimizations
        
        return state
```

### Automation Service Integration

```python
# In enhanced_automation_service.py
async def enhanced_goal_aware_recording(goal: str, **kwargs):
    # Initialize performance monitoring
    performance_agent = PerformanceAgent()
    cost_tracker = CostTracker()
    resource_monitor = ResourceMonitor()
    
    # Start monitoring
    await resource_monitor.start_monitoring()
    
    try:
        # Execute automation with performance tracking
        result = await execute_automation_workflow(goal, **kwargs)
        
        # Analyze performance
        performance_summary = await performance_agent.get_performance_summary()
        cost_analysis = await cost_tracker.analyze_session_costs(session_id)
        
        return {
            "result": result,
            "performance": performance_summary,
            "cost_analysis": cost_analysis,
            "optimizations": performance_summary["optimization_suggestions"]

    finally:
        await resource_monitor.stop_monitoring()
```
